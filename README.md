Frontend Developer Assignment

The skills we’re looking for with this assignment are:

• Ability to create a new React project
• Basic knowledge of TypeScript
• Basic knowledge of React components styling (ex. Using styled-components)
• Proper local and global state management
• Readable code structure

Note. The goal of this assignment is not necessarily to complete it perfectly, more so to create a
natural, maintainable code - and to show an understanding of good development practices. If you
are not familiar with one or more mentioned technologies, and can’t completely finish the
assignment - it’s ok, continue and submit the assignment omitting these parts.

Create an interface for previewing local images

The layout should be based on the picture below. The design itself isn’t a strict requirement, it
functions more as an example:

Expected features:

• User should be able to select and upload an image from their drive (local-upload only,
without an API)
• Last 5 uploaded images should be stored in memory and shown in the list
• User should be able to click an image in the list and preview it
• Preview can use either a simple <img> tag or a three.js <boxGeometry>
  
The finished assignment should be self-contained - you can share the results as a Github
repository or a zipped folder (if the project uses a bundler, please do not include “node_modules”
in the folder.)
